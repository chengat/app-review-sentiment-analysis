      "name.kunes.android.launcher.demo, Johanna Rosner, This app forgets most of its own settings after a reboot. Some settings it forgets even during normal use. Been playing around with it since hours, trying to research and find solutions. For example you choose your Favorites among the contacts - Next reboot they are not favorites anymore. Favorites are empty again. You choose you not to show \"my contacts\" , but only favorites. That one is gone after like a couple of mins later too, without reboot. Other bad things: The setting to directly dial when clicking a contact does not work at all, even the app does not forget the setting itself. There seems to be no visible option add \"Favorites\" itself to the main screen as button. Even thats what most (old) people would want normally. When opening contacts there is no green \"Dial\" symbol or anything. You need to click on the textbox where is the phone number to dial it, which is not very intuitive. OS: Android 10 / AndroidOne, Phone: Nokia 2.3 Too bad i already paid for both Big Phone and Big Launcher. UPDATE: I just figured out why this happened: It seems it cannot properly deal with SIM contacts. I moved my contacts to the phone storage and now it does not forget favorites & other settings anymore. And yes i have activated the inheritance, but that was not the cause of the problem. Its still active and now its fine., 4\n",

I downloaded the demo version onto my own phone and was really impressed how it performed. The simple and clear UI was so easy to use. I.purchased all parts of the application and installed it on my Mother's phone. She really liked it but unfortunately but there appears to be some proprietary software in the phone (Vodafone) which prevents Big Phone from being the default dialer. Daniel was extremely helpful in trying to resolve this issue but it seems the phone is not compatible so was given a refund. Such a pity as this excellent app was perfect for my Mother's needs., 5\n",

Comparing the sentiments retrieved by Textblob and Vader to the user's rating of the app, there doesn't seem to be clear cut relationship between them.

    "|\"Defeats the purpose. If the app is for older people/people that have a hard time using a phone.... then why litter the app for popup ads? Its deceitful and irresponsible. I wanted something good for my grandfather to use and this is NOT the move. Y'all suck on God\"|The Advertisement problem is something the developers should take care of, as soon as possible because there are many user reviews complaining about the pestring and intrusive ads. Ads are a way to monetize your application but given this app is built with the intention of helping the elderly, pop-up ads does quite the opposite and can confuse or decieve them. The developers might want to re-think how they implement ads in their app.|\n",
    "|\"Easy layout. Ease of access is great. However, would like it to have a weather widget and dark mode option. Possibly add a high contrast option (like blue and yellow) for visually impaired people like me. Thanks\"| Developers should consider prioritizing features like the ones suggested in this user review because the elderly have poor vision as they age. Ease of accessibility is one of the pillars of apps that aim to help the seniors, therefore, the developers must consider this review pretty seriously.|\n",
    "|\"Well, I used to have this on my mom's phone, and it was great, but now it just crashes. Wrote support, never heard back, so 1 star feels generous at this point. Update: finally heard back from the developer. As it turns out they haven't kept up with Android updates from months ago.\"|Reliability and optimization should be at the forefront when developing an application, especially one that is designed for helping senior citizens. There were a good amount of reviews from users where they were complaining about the poor reliability of the application and since this review got a response back from the developer citing that lack of optimization for the newer updates is the reason behind the poor reliability, it indicates that the developers are doing a poor job maintaining their application. Developers must consider strengthening the maintainability of their application.|\n",
    "|\"I think there is an unnecessarily large number of steps required to call a contact. First you select the person you want to contact (that's fine), then you select call (as opposed to send a text message).At that point, the person's number should be called. But instead, confusingly, there is yet another step in which you have to elect to call the person.\"|The basis of this application was to simplify the experience of using a cellphone for the senior citizens. Judging just based on this review, it seems like the developers have unintentionally done quite the opposite  and made the basic operations of cellphone, like making a call, more complicated. The developers must prioritize and re-think and refactor their implementation so that they can achieve a more simplified user experience.|\n",
    "|\"PLEASE MAKE YOUR APP'S SETTINGS ICON PASSWORD PROTECTED! Using latest paid version. Absolutely need to lock your settings. My elderly brother accidentally creates havoc by stumbling into Settings and then other screens. He only needs to make and receive calls. Simple. Let's lock him out of everything else, please!\"| The developer should look into this feature request and consider prirotizing this user review because being able to easily customize is a core user requirement. However, if whatever customizations the user did can easily or accidentally be overridden, then it defeats the purpose of the customization. Therfore, if a way to lock and save the customaztion can be implemented then, the developer must look into it. |"
