"com.SeniorEasyPhone, Donald Brown Jr., The first app that looks like it will work for my 85year old uncle and ads prevent the functionality. This really passes me off, 1"
"com.SeniorEasyPhone, David Mcmillan, Defeats the purpose. If the app is for older people/people that have a hard time using a phone.... then why litter the app for popup ads? Its deceitful and irresponsible. I wanted something good for my grandfather to use and this is NOT the move. Y'all suck on God, 1"

"com.SeniorEasyPhone, A Google user, This app is for old people that don't know how to use smart phones , the developer decided to have an add on the bottom of the screen all the time , of course old people press this add all the time for mistake and get lost. unistalled this, 1"
"com.SeniorEasyPhone, A Google user, my list of contacts and icons to place s call to a contact is small and hard for me to see. This app did not help that, 2"
"com.SeniorEasyPhone, A Google user, Looked promising and then the ads popped up. Those would completely confused by mom, and defeats the purpose of having a simple launcher for an elderly person!, 2"

"com.senior_safety_phone, Jim Stanley, Sorry had to uninstall to many offline ads to much of a distraction for the person using it will look elsewhere. 2.5 stars, 3"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Josh Miller, I recently downloaded this app on my Mom's smartphone and she loves it. She feels so comfortable using her smartphone now! The large buttons, texts, and simple layout makes this very user-friendly for elderly people to use all their smartphone features. Thank you for making this app., 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Jane Becker, I previously purchased this app. Now its requiring me to pay a subscription for our new phone. Also all the apps I want have trashcan icons next to them. How can I remove that so my mom doesn't delete them. This app really should be password protected. It too easy for her to accidentally change all the settings and delete things. Potentially a great app but needs work., 2"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Veronica Cortez, The app is the best I've found thus far. The buttons are large, screen is customizable. Only suggestion is to remove the ""remove from favorite"" button on the favorites list screen. My mom keeps removing me from her favorite screen., 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Kate Lehman, Thought maybe the app would help my senior mom but I installed to try and it won't even open. Keeps stopping. Useless. Uninstalled. Too bad!, 1"

"com.senior_safety_phone, Alaina Weidner, This app is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately the very first setting allows you to disable it. Took my mom one day to hit that then it was right back to the confusing phone for her. Please make that setting password protected or at very least move it to the bottom of the settings., 3"
"com.senior_safety_phone, S BF, THIS IS A SCAM!, 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Lois Young, Confusing, 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Pascalle Ricard, This app is such a great idea and structure however it is completely useless with the inclusion of the ads. The purpose of the app being a minimalist and accessible interface for the senior user is nonexistent because the ads confuse and distract the senior user from accessing the simple buttons available. An ad free version must be made available in order for this app to actually do what it is to do, 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, game play, Could be a winner if u where able to place more icons on the HOME SCREEN, 2"
"com.senior_safety_phone, RavenSpazz Rockstar, Easy layout. Ease of access is great. However, would like it to have a weather widget and dark mode option. Possibly add a high contrast option (like blue and yellow) for visually impaired people like me. Thanks., 3"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Chang Nyuk Sang, I have been looking for the right app for seniors for quite sometime and this is exactly what i am looking for. The design comes with contact and apps shortcut in one page which is very easy to use for elderly who has never use a smartphone before without the need to navigate different pages. Touch button is also touch friendly, no more worries about long press button. I hope next update will include simple theming such as dark mode, other than that it is perfect, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, JoAnn Hayes, Horrible. Don't install. Messes up your phone, 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Paul West, This seems good much easier to use than others especially with the simple speed dial. BUT. ... when a call comes into the phone, the phone rings, but there is absolutely no notification or screen or button or anything to press to pick up the phone call. ? How do you answer a phonecall?, 4"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Ove Bjelke-Holtermann, Android 11 kills this app (reported, so known to developer - there was a single response with a promised update in November, which never happened). Support has not responded to subsequent messages since 11/24/2020, effectively rendering the app (or rather, the full phone, as the app was required to make it useful to the user) useless after the android 11 update., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Anne Thomas, Fantastic for my dad, everything on one page! Godsend, but it crashed on his pixel! Bring it back!!!!!!, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, The Law Office of Dr Curtis FJ Doebbler, Slow, not intuitive, and very limited options. Not value money. Performance is very poor on Samsung Tab A (2020). It has been almost impossible for elderly persons for whom I care to use. A very poor app and waste of money, in my opinion., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Josh Hoobler, Well, I used to have this on my mom's phone, and it was great, but now it just crashes. Wrote support, never heard back, so 1 star feels generous at this point. Update: finally heard back from the developer. As it turns out they haven't kept up with Android updates from months ago., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Peter Johnson, Great, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Vicki Dancer, Great, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Rajendra Patel, Sfjol, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Enid Weber, Nice app. Just what I wanted. But there seems to be no way to answer incoming calls. There's a system notification that displays briefly and if I click that i can see the call screen and answer. But that goes away quickly and won't be obvious to my MIL. Once that's gone there is no obvious way to answer the call., 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Drake Hatfield, Not enough customization. No ability to remove the app drawer which gets hit often on accident. No ability to remove the contacts section or to have it automatically link to starred list in Google contacts. The contacts section is not scrollable. Instead there is a small button on the right that has to be tapped. I would be glad to pay for the full version but none of these features are available in the pro version either., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, Bruce Watson, Nice, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, I am using it at d moment, and very happy with it, maybe some updates to change screen, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Excited to use the app for my 90 year old grandfather. Liked what i saw from free version so bought the app. However soon after i started getting problems with the launcher conflicting with the samsung launcher re: default launcher. I have to constantly reset the default launcher to this app - which makes the simplicity and therefore purpose or this app pointless for my grandfather. Other app users have suffered the same issue as seen in other reviews. Do not recommend at all., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, I really like this interface, it's simple but customisable. The only issue my mum has is that the native screen takes over whilst you are in a call, and this can look different depending on behaviour of the user. If you are able to develop a consistent appearance during calls this would be a great improvement., 4"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Very useful, but need to display more favorite contacts on the main screen. When can we expect the next release?, 4"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Very comfy, well designed!, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Works great for my p's. Notification - new message - would be huge improvement. I've consider installing on my pnone. For those who don't like adds, pay thc fee, This is how they get paid. No money - No one to work on improvements. Please incrase the Qty of conacts on main screen. Mom & dad have 5 Dr. No space left friends & family., 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Ny father is 85 and does not know how to use his phone outside of this app. Every so often, He says he cannot do anything in his phone. I look at it and Senior Safety phone is no longer running as the default home screen even though it is supposedly locked on. Very frustrating, 2"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Worked like a charm!, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Great for my dad, but ads were distracting and confusing for him. So deleted the app., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, £1.79 to remove Ads seems reasonable and essential. App works well for me on Sony XA2 I didn't like the way it shamelessly promoted other apps from the same developer., 3"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, This is perfect for my dad. It was constantly darling incorrectly. The large buttons and the big names for contacts really helps. It's also good that he can't turn down the volume by accident, so now he always hears when the phone rings, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Very good, 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, I think there is an unnecessarily large number of steps required to call a contact. First you select the person you want to contact (that's fine), then you select call (as opposed to send a text message).At that point, the person's number should be called. But instead, confusingly, there is yet another step in which you have to elect to call the person., 3"

"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, phone dialer does not work with latest update!!!!! ** app updated again but still does not work. what a waste.  Sorry - it's still not fixed after the update version 3.1.  Contact me if you need to test directly on a Huawei device., 1"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, New version works much better. Thank you for the update., 5"
"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Pretty good, However one extremely important feature is the locking of icons on home screen to prevent changes. My mom has problems with touch controls. sometimes she presses an icon for to long. She gets confused when the delete option appears instead of the app launching., 3"

"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, There are a number of problems with the notification features of this app. I have reported these months ago but have not received ANY reply from the company. Apps that aren't supported should never be installed and should be removed from the Play Store. Don't count on this app to help you UPDATE: Most of the issues have been resolved. I am now testing it out., 4"

"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Pentru cineva care vrea meniuri mari _i simplificate pare OK.  Unele  ”facilit__i” presupun îns_ instalarea unor ter_e aplica_ii, cea mai interesant_ poate  pentru seniori - ”Fall detection ” NU este gratuit_ (cost_ 14 lei în feb. 2018, n-am testat-o).

"com.senior_safety_phone, A Google user, Simple and user friendly UI makes this a great application .. very much thankful to locate and SOS options .. also the volume locking option is good !, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Hammad Mansoor, Loved its deaign. Easier than Big Laubcher. But there is one BAD drawback. Cant search in contacts to add them to favorites. I have over 2000 contacts, i am giving this phone to my mother, and cant enlist her favorite contacts. Thats just poor UI/UX, 2"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, GTU MATERIALS FOR DIPLOMA, Great Ui make it more better than it will be unbeatable launcher.., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Jason Marr, Over all launcher os really good, might be better if we had a search function when adding favourite apps, a bit of a pain going through all the apps to look for what you want, apart from that when it's all setup, it works a dream for my gran, 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Pink Budgie, Absolutely rubbish app that doesn't work, 1"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, jagadish prasad bisoi, Really helpful app for senior Citizens . Very Good App ., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Angela E, Decent app, one major flaw, however. Installed this for my nana and phone calls cannot go through? couldn't recieve calls from relatives and even the doctors. Would also be nice if they added wallpapers., 2"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Harshita, Excellent app.. but need some customization and improvements 1. There is no need of all app button it may shift to 3 dot bar. 2. After locking the phone launcher should be reseted to contact screen & after unlocking it should show the contact menu again this will simply reset the launcher UI if wrongly clicked 3. There should be options for single menu or 2 menus.. for single menu there should be selection options either you want apps or contacts only, 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Rinku Parekh, Thisn is really simple app for elders. I downloaded it for my father., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Meiti Aphane, Can we have the option to lock All Apps?, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Prem Lata Arora, Does not tolerate system update, sometimes even reboot. Frequent Contacts vanish and app keeps trying to load them. Can be corrected by reinstall sometimes., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Jesse Mills, Woeksa as expected. Would be a nice addition if you could search all other apps rather than scrolling through the list. Or being able to completely hide apps.continue, 4"

"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Jorri Navarro, My aunt just went to use the microphone to send a text message and it said it wasn't supported. Any idea what happened?, 3"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Vicki Parker, Love this app! Superior to all the others I tried for my elderly aunt. The only thing that would be really wonderful is if you could Please add a way so that you can see from the home screen phone and message apps if you've missed a call or a text. If you could do that this app would be perfect!!, 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Alien On Vacation, Actually very good app for seniors, and it's free... Try it and think about it..., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Savanna Honerkamp-Smith, Downloaded this for my father. The set-up is intuitive and it's easy to figure out how to edit which you have selected for favorite apps or contacts. My one suggestion would be adding a way to search contacts by name to add them since many people have dozens (or hundreds!) to scroll through. Really grateful this app doesn't collect data! It's just a straightforward solution to a problem that helps lots of people!, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Jessie Phillips, This is great, I use this because I don't like smart phone layouts this makes the phone easier to use thank you, __, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Luke “Hazimaru” Sully, Fantastic app to help my elderly parent still use her phone, really scales back to the bare essentials in the best way possible. One thing I wish was possible was to be able to remove the apps screen from the main area and instead just have the contacts on constant display, it's the one thing my mum trips up on but otherwise great work!, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Rajesh Kumar, An amazing app. My nani thanks you and sends you best wishes, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Mr John, saw the launching screen but then closed automatically for Nokia 1, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Stefan Krzemi_ski, Best simple UI I tried so far. I think it is missing an option to make contacts the default page (instead of apps)., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, J Gillman, A great app, but it can't be used without badging for unread items. I know you've previously said ""I'll have to do it such that seniors installing this app by themselves are not overwhelmed. In the meanwhile, android notifications panel is still at the top to view notifications"" but I wonder how many seniors are doing this themselves? I would think many people are doing this for the seniors in their lives. The notification bar at the top is too small and confusing to be of use to many., 3"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Boink erz, Keeps UI nice and simple with large icons, perfect for my Mum with failing eyesight. This has helped her not get overwhelmed and navigate her phone easily. She didn't want to use it when I mentioned the name Elder Launcher but quickly came around when she started using it. Maybe renaming it Simple launcher or similar will encourage more to use it?. Thanks Devs for this great App!, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Kanaksinh Jadeja, No ads, simple and perfact for elderly people. Good job bapu I m using this since 2021, it's doing great job, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Chelsea White, Liptasf..., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Mark Greenberg, The one thing we attempt to make easier for the aged is use. The app is great for limiting clutter on the desktop of the phone. The problem I see is that once the app is active there is no notification of WhatsApp messages that are received. You need to go into the app before you can tell that there is a message waiting for you. How will they know they have a message waiting?, 2"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Margaret Cooper, This is the best launcher I've tried. Gets rid of all the unwanted stuff. I would have preferred the contacts to be on the home screen rather than the apps., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, NinjaBard Pheonix, If the user has a little experience with phones, this is a snappy easy to use launcher. Nice., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, David Lynch, Amazing! I love it. Wanted a simple phone for elder parents, and now I can get any phone and put this on it! Thanks, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, David LaFlower, Awesome for my Dad. Recently, the contacts screen has been constantly hanging there, so it's unusable., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Nditsheni Shane Nenzhelele, Good, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, First Last, I found it looking for an app for my parents. One of many tested. The chosen one, so far. I am using it also for me., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Venkateshwara Prasad Yethadka, Best home screen app for people who have never used feature or smartphone - especially very elderly and those with learning disability. One suggestion - if you could add a setting/option by which the contact gets called immediately on touching ( without the popup showing number and call button) it will be even more friendlier for very elderly people with no knowledge of multi-level user interfaces., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, ReL Clan, this is the people who make a difference in the world, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Dan Luca, Looks very promising! The only thing that I miss is the possibility to use a language other than english for the user interface. Good job!, 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Joseph Younger, Nice idea, but crashes upon loading into memory on my device. Suspect issue could be related to no notification access., 3"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Gary Osborne, Restored my father's ability to use a phone during the final moths of his life. Thanks for being there for him., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, mema tsagaratos, Program ok, but...you cannot add the phone app to the apps list or access a dialer from thebxontacts area. What if I want to dial a number? Cannot do it without first adding it as a contact, putting it in favorites, then activating it from the favorite contacts list... imagine trying to dial 911 in an emergency if you didnt have the forethought to already add it as above..., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Ronnie Judd, Love your app! Wish I could edit names on the tiles. But it is a wonderful launcher for us old folks __, 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Anshul Gupta, Excellent app fo elders and psychiatric patients Note 1. Behaves erratic on opening app again and also in cascade windows button 2. Call should be connected directly from icon 3. No search type bar. Has to scroll for choosing favs 4. Reordering of main tabs as elders mostly uses call option. 6. Keep 3 4 screens/tabs namely calling (priority 1), most used apps, bank apps (keep customisable). 7. Automatic screen rotation should be disabled., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Matt Lieberson, This worked great for my Mom who is older and not tech savvy. Interface is simple and user friendly. Just wish there were app icon badges for email and text messages. It would be nice if there was a number on top of the app icon so that she knows if she has a new message. The notifications at the top of phone are too small for her to see and not as easy for her to understand., 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Buy AlitaDVD, Name of app isn't very appropriate. Not all seniors have vision problems. Im 51 and I have. I need +2.75 reading glasses just to use this app. But helps much if I lose glasses., 2"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Abhilasha Agiwal, Downloaded this app for my granny but turned out sad. Most old people need 3 things, 1. Clean UI, this the app had in a very limited way but quite unsatisfactory. Older people cannot keep taking multiple times to achieve what they want. 2. Big keypad with clear big (adjustable size) red and green buttons for call, this the app does not have 3. loud ringtone, app uses phone ringtone so not useful., 2"

"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Jose Aguirre, Great , very simple, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, A Cooper, Very good., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Eleanor Swartz, I think this is the best app for simplifying the home screen for older people so far. The only thing is I wish it had notification dots on the apps, or just put the notifications on the screen so you have to read them before you can go back to the home screen., 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, MOUNEASH JAYAM, Amazing app.i will highly recommend this app for senior citizens., 5"

"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Goolam Vajeth, The App looks good. I have a question. Is it possible to swap the ""Apps"" and ""Contacts""? I want Contacts to be the default screen. It only allows me to add 3 favorite contacts. How do I add more?, 4"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Ori Chandrakala, Superrrrr love this app because my grand maa use this app __________________, 5"
"xyz.arjunsinh.elderlauncher, Patrick Olson, This is a decent launcher for visually impaired. There are a couple improvements needed. If you use dark mode, often when going home, a white screen appears before seeing the home screen. No launcher should have a loading screen, but this does. I wish pressing home when on home screen would bring you to top of favorites. Instead, one must scroll to top to get to most used/important apps., 4"

"name.kunes.android.launcher.demo, Mark Macc, I put this app on a elderly relative's tablet and it's fantastic. Big clear buttons and easy to configure.

I would like the option to remove the signal strength graphic as it's pointless on a tablet. Second I would like to be able to configure the SOS button to email a number of recipients.

"name.kunes.android.launcher.demo, Johanna Rosner, This app forgets most of its own settings after a reboot. Some settings it forgets even during normal use. Been playing around with it since hours, trying to research and find solutions. For example you choose your Favorites among the contacts - Next reboot they are not favorites anymore. Favorites are empty again. You choose you not to show ""my contacts"" , but only favorites. That one is gone after like a couple of mins later too, without reboot. Other bad things: The setting to directly dial when clicking a contact does not work at all, even the app does not forget the setting itself. There seems to be no visible option add ""Favorites"" itself to the main screen as button. Even thats what most (old) people would want normally. When opening contacts there is no green ""Dial"" symbol or anything. You need to click on the textbox where is the phone number to dial it, which is not very intuitive. OS: Android 10 / AndroidOne, Phone: Nokia 2.3 Too bad i already paid for both Big Phone and Big Launcher. UPDATE: I just figured out why this happened: It seems it cannot properly deal with SIM contacts. I moved my contacts to the phone storage and now it does not forget favorites & other settings anymore. And yes i have activated the inheritance, but that was not the cause of the problem. Its still active and now its fine., 4"

I.purchased all parts of the application and installed it on my Mother's phone.

"name.kunes.android.launcher.demo, A Google user, It was okay but needs work. Not being able to swipe thru screens was a drag. My one tap apps & one tap to call contacts turned into more than one tap also. Dialer One & Handscent take care of enlarging text well enough for me. I'd purchase this app if grows into something more customizable., 2"

"name.kunes.android.launcher.demo, A Google user, I downloaded this app but had to uninstall. I need it for my elderly mom. Ideally only the keys that are part of your app would be available to her. No pull downs or small font anywhere. Would like her to receive photos and be notified of texts or voicemails. When she types the largest font should be available. Also a speakerphone should be available and the ability to google. Thanks., 2"

"name.kunes.android.launcher.demo, A Google user, Applications show up now. Force closing fixed problem. I use one spot to launch a different launcher and the other launcher has a link back to this one. Really great. Only thing I would like is a counter to display unread text and emails. Wanted to use this but absolutely no applications show up on the droid x. The word applications shows up, but none of them appear. I tried pressing every button to get them to show so I could select some, but nothing ever shows up. I even tried enable and disable all apps, but nothing. I would love to try this., 4"

"com.uncomplicat.launcher, Carolyn Kissinger-Elkins, Not an intuitive interface and I'm 60 so I was hoping this would be what I was looking for but I'm using Niagara because Nova keeps crashing on me and Nova is my favorite launcher. I paid for the pro version but I don't regret it because I'm sure there are some older people and those with eyesight problems that will benefit from it so think of it as buying the dev a Coke., 2"
